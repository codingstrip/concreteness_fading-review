# Concreteness Fading (Literature Review)

For comprehensive literature review, we conducted a systematic search with six research databases covering all potential disciplines: computing (ACM Digital Library and IEEE Xplore); Education (ERIC), Multidisciplinary (SCOPUS, Google Scholar, Web of Science). Also, we expanded our search queries beyond "concreteness fading" to include other terminologies, as listed below. 

## Keywords
- concreteness fading
- concrete fading
- concrete to abstract
- progressive formalization
- progressive idealization
- concreteness 

## Databases

- [ACM Digital Library](http://dl.acm.org) (Computing)
- [IEEE Xplore](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/Xplore/home.jsp) (Computing)
- [ERIC](https://eric.ed.gov/) (Education)

- [Goolge Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/) (Multidisciplinary)
- [Web of Science](https://webofknowledge.com) (Multidisciplinary)

The following table shows the number of papers for corresponding keyword & database.

|keyword / database| acm | xplore | eric | scopus | google scholar | web of science | total |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|concreteness fading|2|2|11|103|348|10|476|
|progressive formalization|2|4|7|14|10|3|40|
|progressive idealization|2|3|2|3|---|1|11|
|concrete fading|2|7|2|2|36|70|119|
|concrete to abstract|6|171|179|256|980|1|1593|
|concreteness|3749|---|335|---|10|1830|5924|
|total| 3763 | 187 | 536 | 378 | 1384 | 1915 | 8172 |

NOTE: The number of papers after removing redundant papers is 6,613 papers. Besides removing redundant papers, additional pre-processing is necessary to remove irrelevant papers.
